## ❓ Why become a Cardano governance DRep?
- to be a moral and ethical compass
- to represent those who may be challenged by participating in governance;
- to educate, discuss and debate through respectful discourse with all persons;
- to counter the narcicistic greed that is often commonplace within blockchain;
- to provide transparency where it is lacking and where data is intentionally obscured;
- to push Cardano governance beyond one-ada/one-vote and tamp down on the plutocractic nature of blockchain;
- to be the dissenting vote against those who which to gain, maintain or increase their influence on the Cardano blockchain;
- to follow the following principles when considering and voting as a delegate representative:
  - Transparency
  - Equality
  - Education
  - Honesty
  - Inclusivity
  - Self-Sovereignty
  - Decentralization
  - Sustainability
