## Justification for 20% Tax Reduction

Here are my thoughts:

- Potentially forces funded proposers to build products that increase chain usage since there will be reduced funds availability.

- This is an appropriate experiment of governance and the parameter can be reversed or modified in time if side-effects prove too drastic.

- I believe the onboarding opportunity would still remain low and it will have minimal effects on tx count or governance participation.

- More tx fees go to staked wallet holders. This does include CEX and other key holders.

- It can further decentralize (only the security of) the blockchain; but how much is enough, or too much.

- This further increases the size of the wallets at the top.

- It's certainly not going to destroy the blockchain.

- Either way the whales and founders still win but maybe some of the community can receive compensation for the knowledge sharing and extractive nature of all things Cardano.
