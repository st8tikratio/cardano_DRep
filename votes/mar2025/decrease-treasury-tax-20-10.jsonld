This does include CEX and other key holders.\n- It can further decentralize (only the security of) the blockchain; but how much is enough, or too much.\n- This further increases the size of the wallets at the top.\n- It's certainly not going to destroy the blockchain.\n\nEither way the whales and founders still win but maybe some of the community can receive compensation for the knowledge sharing and extractive nature of all things Cardano."
