No matter any potential future good, IMBO has already created a persona it cannot escape.\n\nWhomever reads this rationale be certain that IMBO has taken more effort and time from my life than necessary. The organization is in no state to be making any proposals and the Cardano governance model. however much it is lauded as a breakthrough, a first, a starting point, is indeed broken and prone to absolute abuse. Focus should lie elsewhere, beyond personal agendas, handouts and get-rich-off-the-backs-of-others mentalities.\n\nGood luck Cardano; you deserve and need much more than whatever this is called and whomever they claim to be."
