### [Consolidated Cardano 2025 Budget](https://forum.cardano.org/t/a-cardano-blockchain-ecosystem-budget/143049)
- Where are conflicts of interest listed? Available for the broader community?
- <img width="689" alt="Pasted Graphic 1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/27389af5-6a45-482d-a127-88c9ccce73fd"/>
- What’s the deadline from live doc to final doc?
- <img width="698" alt="Pasted Graphic 2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3e7273d2-940f-433a-8dd4-d959f0e905c9"/>
- Decentralization through centralization?
- <img width="692" alt="Pasted Graphic 3" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/74434656-76ab-4646-9f90-a2baf724471f" />
- Budgets should not be voted on until this information is available.
- <img width="694" alt="Pasted Graphic 4" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7d0ba2b5-253a-4d0d-bb56-98d02571f11c" />
- Non-profits can still, through GAAP, justify high salaries and general grift
- Is this a jab at open-source?
- <img width="687" alt="Pasted Graphic 5" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0b017231-f7e9-42c4-b224-26f9ef3972a7" />
- Otherwise known as we use it in-house for whatever purposes we deem necessary as long as it is not illegal or counter mission
- <img width="684" alt="Pasted Graphic 6" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/296cb155-fa14-44f1-9b4c-a037c251e96d" />
- Provide location of master ledger and sub-ledgers, outside of chain tx hashes; OR provide tool/platform that translates and collates data.
- Where is the pool of global certified auditors? Who are they? Any 
- <img width="689" alt="Pasted Graphic 7" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dffebfa9-e053-4ce4-a513-49fa02bba1bc" />
- Where is the CDH mandate and other documentation?
- <img width="690" alt="Pasted Graphic 8" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/16e5722a-eb97-4467-813a-d8fa32fe2035" />
- Committees decide who can participate within Cardano ecosystem; no unbiased, without influence, path for maintainer replacement
- This ensures a lifetime of maintenance fees for CDH, Intersect.
- <img width="782" alt="Pasted Graphic 9" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9aee8f79-d389-464c-a852-8073780d9c28" />
- [source:](https://docs.intersectmbo.org/intersect-operational-services/intersect-operational-services-overview)
- Intersect Operational Services structure and tree
- <img width="630" alt="Pasted Graphic 10" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cb322edb-d5a1-45ae-b84e-a69acd9292e1" />
- Word-salad,  removing liability mainly from Intersect and its affiliates. Not the broader community; a minor, if any, concern for Intersect
- <img width="691" alt="Pasted Graphic 11" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/06a8ab02-bb9d-4360-8d1d-c2ccfe48b362" />
- The community (which?) may request a time extension before official submission
- <img width="704" alt="Pasted Graphic 12" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f59ee2d3-44db-4b27-9942-0ba500f25035" />
- Who is auditor, or auditor pool?
- Budgets should be locked in, not allowing for, adjustment two weeks prior to formalizing or requesting
- Where are the milestones, deliverables? Surplus being returned to treasury is counter to statements made above in [source doc]
- Open for bidding at what site, location, bulletin, etc?
- <img width="696" alt="Pasted Graphic 13" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/00a2035c-2e22-4ef5-b8b5-4629f35d52f8" />
- Where are these projections? Source 2 above?
- <img width="689" alt="Pasted Graphic" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/02eaf102-3342-46fa-9c02-c48244ea4a64" />
- What/where is the ‘structure evaluation matrix’? 
- Where are the CRDs? Not created yet. These are only created after the proposal is approved through governance method. Committee(s) then create CRDs
- <img width="683" alt="Pasted Graphic 14" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/11e2dcf9-d481-4d74-a42d-f5a066ca5ffe" />
- Are the SLAs available to the broad community? Open? Transparent? Or ‘critical’ and ‘security risk’ cop-out?
- <img width="673" alt="Pasted Graphic 15" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6639bfa1-aaad-4c3e-9343-8d8cad54fb20" />
- What makes a vendor as defined here? Is it intentionally ambiguous? Does it really read ‘Intersect members and vendors (that are part of Intersect)’?
- <img width="664" alt="Pasted Graphic 16" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5888a4d8-9493-44e5-974b-504eecfdb39a" />
- Where are the ecosystem expectations located? Are they in the RFPs, CPS’?
- <img width="675" alt="Pasted Graphic 17" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d441abfb-295c-4f68-be5b-e1b6b69e92eb" />
- Through what process are members selected? Which community? Broad or Intersect?
- <img width="671" alt="Pasted Graphic 18" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e1d8579f-d390-4957-aae2-0d0f58497e00" />
- Who determines these priorities?
- <img width="752" alt="Pasted Graphic 19" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f9519d21-5269-4cfc-b809-9fe831a05271" />
- This would require all budgets, unless filed under one consolidated budget, the submission of a net-change-limit info.action.
- Clarify -> formally agreed upon = ?? applicable governance procedures ?? = formally approved ??
- Second paragraph counters above statement
- <img width="725" alt="Pasted Graphic 20" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/485f051a-0d72-42c7-a004-36540523b554" />
- Info.action first for consensus, then governance.action for ratification ?? Requires 67%  DRep approval.

#### NOTES W/ SCREEN-GRABS:
- <img width="750" alt="Pasted Graphic 21" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cb554800-28eb-4e18-a1a5-4828b1ecd821" />
- Where would this be indicated?
- <img width="769" alt="Pasted Graphic 22" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cab0b9fa-e291-4460-8811-095716eb69b4" />
- Project cards should not continuously be changed; this is transparency overload; two-weeks before budget submission teh card should remain static
- Who determines prioritization? TSC? Using what guidelines, criteria, etc? -> TSC 
- <img width="757" alt="Pasted Graphic 23" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0592ea03-d4fe-4ba6-adac-1e9ab628486a" />
- Delivery assurance teams? Who are these teams?
- <img width="744" alt="Pasted Graphic 24" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/71493213-f77e-4ae7-961c-7172f54735da" />
- Where are these located?
- <img width="755" alt="Pasted Graphic 25" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/12658993-2a91-457e-98eb-13ee152864d9" />
- Further indication that vendors must come from within Intersect or become Intersect members -> Overstepping
- <img width="812" alt="1__#$!@%!#__Pasted Graphic 1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2bc50c66-8ead-43b4-b2c4-11ccf1ee8052" />
- Should not be covered. This is a choice to use AWS.

#### NOTES W/O SCREEN-GRABS
1. How much of the roadmap development are pet-projects? A continual injection of cash into a founding entity?
2. $20k for (efficient) remote running environment running? -> involves what software? Is it open-source? Does the community currently offer that type of SaaS?
3. 6M for Research (this overlaps with RWG budget  request) -> Completely remove from core budget
4. 1.2M for Technical Meetings —> absolutely not - not justified and can be completely virtually
5. 1.0M contributor reimbursement —> let it happen first, provide FTE
    - No to a tender-bid working group until tenders can be generated outside of Intersect
    - How many contributors are there? cap? Seems like knowledge disconnect possible between review, evals and triage groups
6. Hesitant about the Maintainer Retainer Program at 1.8M - the “top echelon” have shown a penchant for centralized, privacy lacking platforms, and continues to. There is no confidence that this oprogram will resolve this communities reliance on Goohle and Amazon.
7. 2.7M for Further Core Cardano Development Projects as proposed and reviewed by the community - absolutely not, finish the other projects with millions already being requested and produce a proven product or service.
8. 175k for incident/Monitoring Response - who is this contract with?
9. 100k for Events - ticket sales; invitees; location distribution; can seem too high or too low depending on historical event data that is where?
10. 50k for OSC Attendance Events - How many personnel? How many events? Events hosted/operated by who?
11. Expanded Cardano Project Support Services - same issues here. What catalog? Where is it? This budget item is too soon.
12. 150k for Expanded Cardano Project Support Services - sounds like fees and costs should be paid by the projects. Why should the community fund a “help desk”?
13. 100k Working Group Commercialization -> NO, not until any sort of functional improvement has been made to current closed-source platforms and migrations
