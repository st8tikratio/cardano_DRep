## Constitution Paramters (05-DEC-2024)
- Symbol and Explanation
  - (y) The Guardrail Script can be used to enforce the Guardrail
  - (x) The Guardrail Script cannot be used to enforce the Guardrail
  - (~ - reason) The Guardrail Script cannot be used to enforce the Guardrail for the reason given, but future ledger changes could enable this.

### UTxO cost per byte
```
Parameter: utxoCostPerByte

Defines the deposit (in lovelace) that is charged for each byte of storage tha is held in a UTxO. This deposit is returned when the UTxO is no longer active.
  ‚Ä¢ Sets a minimum threshold on ada that is held within a single UTxO
  ‚Ä¢ Provides protection against low-cost denial of service attack on UTxO storage. DoS protection decreases in line with the free node memory (proportional to UTxO growth)
  ‚Ä¢ Helps reduce long-term storage costs for node users by providing an incentive to return UTxOs when no longer needed, or to merge UTxOs.

### Stake Address Deposit
```
Parameter: stakeAddressDeposit

Ensures that stake addresses are retired when no longer needed
  ‚Ä¢ Helps reduce long-term storage costs
  ‚Ä¢ Helps limit CPU and memory costs in the ledger

The rationale for the deposit is to incentivize that scarce memory resources are returned when they are no longer required.
Reducing the number of active stake addresses also reduces processing and memory costs at the epoch boundary when calculating stake snapshots.

### Stake Pool Deposit
```
Parameter: stakePoolDeposit

Ensures that stake pools are retired by the stake pool operator when no longer needed by them
  ‚Ä¢ Helps reduce long-term storage costs

The rationale for the deposit is to incentivize that scarce memory resources are returned when they are no longer required.
Rewards and stake snapshot calculations are also impacted by the number of active stake pools.

## 2.3. Network Parameters
```
The overall goals when managing the Cardano Blockchain network parameters are to:

Match the available Cardano Blockchain Layer 1 network capacity to current or future traffic demands,
including payment transactions, layer 1 DApps, sidechain management and governance needs

Balance traffic demands for different user groups, including payment transactions, minters of
sFungible/Non-Fungible Tokens, Plutus scripts, DeFi developers, Stake Pool Operators and voting transactions
```
### Triggers For Change
```
Changes to network parameters may be triggered by:
  ‚Ä¢ Measured changes in traffic demands over a 2-epoch period (10 days)
  ‚Ä¢ Anticipated changes in traffic demands
  ‚Ä¢ Cardano Community requests
```
### Counter-indicators
```
Changes may need to be reversed and/or should not be enacted in the event of:
  ‚Ä¢ Excessive block propagation delays
  ‚Ä¢ Stake pools being unable to handle traffic volume
  ‚Ä¢ Scripts being unable to complete execution
```
### Core Metrics
```
All decisions on parameter changes should be informed by:
  ‚Ä¢ Block propagation delay profile
  ‚Ä¢ Traffic volume (block size over time)
  ‚Ä¢ Script volume (size of scripts and execution units)
  ‚Ä¢ Script execution cost benchmarks
  ‚Ä¢ Block propagation delay/diffusion benchmarks

Detailed benchmarking results are required to confirm the effect of any changes on mainnet performance or
behavior prior to enactment. The effects of different transaction mixes must be analyzed, including normal
transactions, Plutus scripts, and governance actions.
```

Any increase must also consider previously identified future requirements for the total block size (maxBlockBodySize) measured against the total block diffusion target of 3s with 95% block propagation within 5s. Future Plutus performance improvements may allow the per-block step limit to be increased, but must be balanced against the overall diffusion limits as specified in the previous sentence, and future requirements      |
| **MEU** ___NOT IDENTIFIED__                     | MEU-S-01 (~ - no access to existing parameter values) | maxBlockExecutionUnits[steps] must not be less than maxTxExecutionUnits[steps]    |
