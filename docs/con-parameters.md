## Constitution Paramters (05-DEC-2024)
- Symbol and Explanation
  - (y) The Guardrail Script can be used to enforce the Guardrail
  - (x) The Guardrail Script cannot be used to enforce the Guardrail
  - (~ - reason) The Guardrail Script cannot be used to enforce the Guardrail for the reason given, but future ledger changes could enable this.

### UTxO cost per byte
```
Parameter: utxoCostPerByte

Defines the deposit (in lovelace) that is charged for each byte of storage tha is held in a UTxO. This deposit is returned when the UTxO is no longer active.
  ‚Ä¢ Sets a minimum threshold on ada that is held within a single UTxO
  ‚Ä¢ Provides protection against low-cost denial of service attack on UTxO storage. DoS protection decreases in line with the free node memory (proportional to UTxO growth)
  ‚Ä¢ Helps reduce long-term storage costs for node users by providing an incentive to return UTxOs when no longer needed, or to merge UTxOs.

### Stake Address Deposit
```
Parameter: stakeAddressDeposit

Ensures that stake addresses are retired when no longer needed
  ‚Ä¢ Helps reduce long-term storage costs
  ‚Ä¢ Helps limit CPU and memory costs in the ledger

The rationale for the deposit is to incentivize that scarce memory resources are returned when they are no longer required.
Reducing the number of active stake addresses also reduces processing and memory costs at the epoch boundary when calculating stake snapshots.

### Stake Pool Deposit
```
Parameter: stakePoolDeposit

Ensures that stake pools are retired by the stake pool operator when no longer needed by them
  ‚Ä¢ Helps reduce long-term storage costs

The rationale for the deposit is to incentivize that scarce memory resources are returned when they are no longer required.
Rewards and stake snapshot calculations are also impacted by the number of active stake pools.
