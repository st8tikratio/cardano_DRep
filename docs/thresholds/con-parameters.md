  - (x) The Guardrail Script cannot be used to enforce the Guardrail
  - (~ - reason) The Guardrail Script cannot be used to enforce the Guardrail for the reason given, but future ledger changes could enable this.

# 2. Guardrails and Guidelines on Protocol Parameter Update Actions
ðŸ”» Note that users may scroll code blocks left to rightðŸ”»
```
Below are Guardrails and guidelines for changing updatable protocol parameter settings via the protocol parameter
update governance action such that the Cardano Blockchain is never in an unrecoverable state as a result of such changes.

Note that, to avoid ambiguity, this Appendix uses the parameter name that is used in protocol parameter update governance
actions rather than any other convention.

### UTxO cost per byte
```
Parameter: utxoCostPerByte

Defines the deposit (in lovelace) that is charged for each byte of storage tha is held in a UTxO. This deposit is returned when the UTxO is no longer active.
  â€¢ Sets a minimum threshold on ada that is held within a single UTxO
  â€¢ Provides protection against low-cost denial of service attack on UTxO storage. DoS protection decreases in line with the free node memory (proportional to UTxO growth)
  â€¢ Helps reduce long-term storage costs for node users by providing an incentive to return UTxOs when no longer needed, or to merge UTxOs.

### Stake Address Deposit
```
Parameter: stakeAddressDeposit

Ensures that stake addresses are retired when no longer needed
  â€¢ Helps reduce long-term storage costs
  â€¢ Helps limit CPU and memory costs in the ledger

The rationale for the deposit is to incentivize that scarce memory resources are returned when they are no longer required.
Reducing the number of active stake addresses also reduces processing and memory costs at the epoch boundary when calculating stake snapshots.

### Stake Pool Deposit
```
Parameter: stakePoolDeposit

Ensures that stake pools are retired by the stake pool operator when no longer needed by them
  â€¢ Helps reduce long-term storage costs

The rationale for the deposit is to incentivize that scarce memory resources are returned when they are no longer required.
Rewards and stake snapshot calculations are also impacted by the number of active stake pools.

## 2.3. Network Parameters
```
The overall goals when managing the Cardano Blockchain network parameters are to:

Match the available Cardano Blockchain Layer 1 network capacity to current or future traffic demands,
including payment transactions, layer 1 DApps, sidechain management and governance needs

Balance traffic demands for different user groups, including payment transactions, minters of
sFungible/Non-Fungible Tokens, Plutus scripts, DeFi developers, Stake Pool Operators and voting transactions
```
### Triggers For Change
```
Changes to network parameters may be triggered by:
  â€¢ Measured changes in traffic demands over a 2-epoch period (10 days)
  â€¢ Anticipated changes in traffic demands
  â€¢ Cardano Community requests
```
### Counter-indicators
```
Changes may need to be reversed and/or should not be enacted in the event of:
  â€¢ Excessive block propagation delays
  â€¢ Stake pools being unable to handle traffic volume
  â€¢ Scripts being unable to complete execution
```
### Core Metrics
```
All decisions on parameter changes should be informed by:
  â€¢ Block propagation delay profile
  â€¢ Traffic volume (block size over time)
  â€¢ Script volume (size of scripts and execution units)
  â€¢ Script execution cost benchmarks
  â€¢ Block propagation delay/diffusion benchmarks

Detailed benchmarking results are required to confirm the effect of any changes on mainnet performance or
behavior prior to enactment. The effects of different transaction mixes must be analyzed, including normal
transactions, Plutus scripts, and governance actions.

## 2.4 Technical/Security Parameters
```
â€¢ The overall goals when managing the technical/security parameters are:
   1. Ensure the security of the Cardano Blockchain network in terms of decentralization and protection against adversarial actions
   2. Enable changes to the Plutus language
```

```
1. Changes in the number of active SPOs
2. Changes to the Plutus language
3. Security threats
4. Cardano Community requests
```
### Counter-indicators
```
â€¢ Economic concerns, e.g. when changing the number of stake pools
```

### Core Metrics
```
â€¢Â Number of stake pools
â€¢ Level of decentralization
```

### Target Number of Stake Pools
```
Parameter: stakePoolTargetNum

```
Parameter: costModels

Define the base costs for each Plutus primitive in terms of CPU and memory unit

## 2.5 Governance Parameters
```
The overall goals when managing the governance parameters are to:
  â€¢ Ensure governance stability
  â€¢ Maintain a representative form of governance
```

### Triggers for Change
```

  â€¢ Cardano Community requests
  â€¢ Regulatory requirements
  â€¢ Unexpected or unwanted governance outcomes
  â€¢ Entering a state of no confidence
```

Changes may need to be reversed and/or should not be enacted in the event of:
  â€¢ Unexpected effects on governance
  â€¢ Excessive Layer 1 load due to on-chain voting or excessive numbers of governance actions
```

### Core Metrics
```
All decisions on parameter changes should be informed by:
  â€¢ Governance participation levels
  â€¢ Governance behaviors and patterns
  â€¢ Regulatory considerations
  â€¢ Confidence in the governance system
  â€¢ The effectiveness of the governance system in managing necessary change
```

## 2.6. Monitoring and Reversion of Parameter Changes
```
All network parameter changes must be monitored carefully for no less than 2 epochs (10 days)
  â€¢ Changes must be reverted as soon as possible if block propagation delays exceed 4.5s for more than 5% of blocks over any 6 hour rolling window

All other parameter changes should be monitored
  â€¢ The reversion plan should be implemented if the overall effect on performance, security, functionality or long-term sustainability is unacceptable.

A specific reversion/recovery plan must be produced for each parameter change. This plan must include:
  â€¢ Which parameters need to change and in which ways in order to return to the previous state (or a similar state)
  â€¢ How to recover the network in the event of disastrous failure

This plan should be followed if problems are observed following the parameter change. Note that not all changes can be reverted. Additional care must be taken when making changes to these parameters.
```

## 2.7. Non-Updatable Protocol Parameters
```
Some fundamental protocol parameters cannot be changed by the Protocol Parameter Update governance action.
These parameters can only be changed in a new Genesis file as part of a hard fork.
It is not necessary to provide specific guardrails on updating these parameters.
```

# 4. Guardrails and Guidelines on Hard Fork Initiation Actions
```
The hard fork initiation action requires both a new major and a new minor protocol version to be specified.
  â€¢ As positive integers

As the result of a hard fork, new updatable protocol parameters may be introduced. Guardrails may be defined for these parameters, which will take effect following the hard fork. Existing updatable protocol parameters may also be deprecated by the hard fork, in which case the guardrails become obsolete for all future changes.
